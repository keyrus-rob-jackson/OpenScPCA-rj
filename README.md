# OpenScPCA-nf

A workflow for running analysis modules ported from the [OpenScPCA-analysis repository](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-analysis) to [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io).

See https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenScPCA-admin/blob/main/technical-docs/nextflow-workflow-specifications.md for initial implementation plans for this workflow.

## Repository setup

This repository uses [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com) to enforce code style and formatting.
To install the pre-commit hooks described in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, run the following command in the repository root:

```bash
pre-commit install
```
